# `stf-under-construction`
This is the static site which early visitors to `https://spooky.tf` should be greeted with. It uses no custom JS, and can be easily thrown up as a static website with the root directory pointed at `./html/`

## Design
There was an original design of the site which involved less ridiculous loud background and more sensible words and things, but it seemed that this version was overall very boring so we switched to this current iteration.

## Author
[`zudsniper@github`](https://github.com/zudsniper) is the author of this rudimentary website, while the cool visuals were created by [`@serialartistry`](https://twitter.com/serialartistry) on twitter.
